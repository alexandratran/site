    	A blockchain is a cryptographically linked list of “blocks”, which contain transaction data. It is the ledger, the backbone, of most cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin), and is typically maintained by a decentralized, peer-to-peer network governed by a consensus protocol. It is a data structure and a decentralized ecosystem model that may be applied to non-currency use cases.
		<br><br>
		I like blockchain technology because it turns our traditional assumptions about trust, authority, and coordination upside down and is a tool to undermine locked-in infrastructure (think banks, supply chains, energy distribution, etc.) in a provably secure manner.
		<br><br>
		Not all projects call for a blockchain. Not all blockchains are equal. Not all cryptocurrencies use blockchains.
		<br><br>
		When I first started learning about Bitcoin in late 2016, something that kickstarted my interest in the computer science behind it was reading, from cover to cover, <a class="textlink" href="https://bitcoinbook.info/" target="_blank">Mastering Bitcoin</a> by Andreas Antonopoulos and <a class="textlink" href="http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> by a team at Princeton. I also went through Blockchain at Berkeley’s pilot <a class="textlink" href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/sp18/fund/" target="_blank">cryptocurrency course</a> for undergrads, which I later helped lead.
  		<br><br>
  		My interests in the space lie among scalability (how to build scalable cryptocurrencies and scale existing ones), governance (how to perfect the governance of blockchains and use blockchains to govern people), privacy and anonymity (how to protect oneself using blockchain and cryptography), and cryptoeconomics (how to achieve robust consensus properties in complex coordination systems).
  		<br><br>
  		Knowledge is power in this space. I ran a "Deep Dive" event series for many months where people gathered and read about blockchain topics. <a class="textlink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12w7rAEQUSFd6NbLr6dUxJcLbF70YHcnzhG6mHZQjYCA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> are the curated materials, which you may find useful. I listen to many crypto podcasts, including <a class="textlink" href="https://epicenter.tv/" target="_blank">Epicenter</a>, <a class="textlink" href="https://www.bitcoin.kn/about/" target="_blank">The Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast</a>, and <a class="textlink" href="https://thecryptoshow.com/" target="_blank">The Crypto Show</a>. I don't use Twitter, but if I did, I would follow Max Fang's <a class="textlink" href="https://twitter.com/MaxFangX/lists/blockchain-starter-pack" target="_blank">blockchain starter pack</a>.
  		<br><br>
		I currently intern at <a class="textlink" href="https://www.daglabs.com/" target="_blank">DAGlabs</a>, a company building a scalable, privacy-centric cryptocurrency based off of the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yoni_sompo/pubs/17/SPECTRE.pdf" target="_blank">SPECTRE</a> and <a class="textlink" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf" target="_blank">PHANTOM</a> protocols (whose authors lead the company's research and development efforts).
