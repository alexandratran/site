    	A blockchain is a cryptographically linked list of “blocks”, which contain data about transactions. It is the ledger, the backbone, of most cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin), and is typically maintained by a decentralized, peer-to-peer network governed by a consensus protocol. It is a data structure and a decentralized system design that may be applied to non-currency use cases.
		<br><br>
		I like blockchain technology because it is a tool to undermine or improve upon locked-in infrastructure (think banks, land registries, standard networking protocols, supply chains, etc.) in a provably secure manner, subverting traditions of trust, authority, and centralized coordination.
		<br><br>
		When I started learning about Bitcoin in late 2016, something that kickstarted my interest in the computer science behind it was reading <a class="textlink" href="https://bitcoinbook.info/" target="_blank">Mastering Bitcoin</a> by Andreas Antonopoulos and <a class="textlink" href="http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> by a team at Princeton. I also went through Blockchain at Berkeley’s pilot <a class="textlink" href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/sp18/fund/" target="_blank">cryptocurrency course</a> for undergrads, which I later helped lead.
  		<br><br>
  		My interests in the space lie in scalability (how to build scalable cryptocurrencies and scale existing ones), governance (how to produce reliable systems of coordination and evolution), privacy and anonymity (how to protect oneself using blockchain and cryptography), and cryptoeconomics (how to achieve robust consensus properties in complex coordination systems).
  		<br><br>
  		Knowledge is power in this space. I ran a "Deep Dive" event series for many months where people gathered and read about blockchain topics. <a class="textlink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12w7rAEQUSFd6NbLr6dUxJcLbF70YHcnzhG6mHZQjYCA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> are the curated materials, which you may find useful. I listen to many crypto podcasts, including <a class="textlink" href="https://epicenter.tv/" target="_blank">Epicenter</a>, <a class="textlink" href="https://www.bitcoin.kn/about/" target="_blank">The Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast</a>, and <a class="textlink" href="https://thecryptoshow.com/" target="_blank">The Crypto Show</a>. I don't use Twitter, but if I did, I would follow Max Fang's <a class="textlink" href="https://twitter.com/MaxFangX/lists/blockchain-starter-pack" target="_blank">blockchain starter pack</a>.
  		<br><br>
		I currently do research at <a class="textlink" href="https://www.daglabs.com/" target="_blank">DAGlabs</a>, a company building a scalable, privacy-centric cryptocurrency based off of the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yoni_sompo/pubs/17/SPECTRE.pdf" target="_blank">SPECTRE</a> and <a class="textlink" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf" target="_blank">PHANTOM</a> protocols (whose authors lead the company's research and development efforts).
  		<br><br>
  		Finally, I want to note that there are <a class="textlink" href="https://twitter.com/ncweaver/status/980485587827224577" target="_blank">so</a>

  		<a class="textlink" href="https://hackernoon.com/the-five-keys-to-crypto-evolution-94be921e6354" target="_blank">right now</a>. Thus, I encourage skepticism when navigating this space. At the same time, I have faith that many of these barriers can be overcome with better design, better apps, better security, and better education.
