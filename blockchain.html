    	A blockchain is a cryptographically linked list of “blocks”, which contain transaction data. It is the ledger, the backbone, of most cryptocurrencies, and is maintained by a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, which is governed by a consensus protocol.
		<br><br>
		I like blockchain technology because it turns our traditional assumptions about trust and authority upside down and is a tool to undermine inadequate, centralized, locked-in infrastructure (think banks, supply chains, energy distribution, etc.) in a provably secure manner.
		<br><br>
		Not all use cases call for a blockchain. Not all blockchains are equal. Not all cryptocurrencies use blockchains.

		When I first started learning about Bitcoin in fall of 2016, something that kickstarted my interest in the computer science behind it was reading, from cover to cover, <a class="textlink" href="https://bitcoinbook.info/">Mastering Bitcoin</a> by Andreas Antonopoulos and <a class="textlink" href="http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/">Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</a> by a team at Princeton. I also went through Blockchain at Berkeley’s pilot <a href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/sp18/fund/">cryptocurrency course</a> for undergrads, which I later helped lead.
