    	I live a partially examined life.
    	<br><br>
    	(This phrase is attributed to Socrates' <a class="textlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living" target="_blank">famous quote</a>, and more so to this <a class="textlink" href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/" target="_blank">philosophy podcast</a> that I love.)
    	<br><br>
    	I am and always have been a voracious reader&mdash;which is how I encountered the field of philosophy when I was younger. It started with an interest in primary religious texts, then apologetics, then philosophy of religion, then metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. A philosopher that sparked my interest in the field early on is Miguel de Unamuno, a Spaniard whose writing style and ideas, while very accessible, don't really fit into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_philosophy" class="textlink" target="_blank">continental</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy" class="textlink" target="_blank">analytic</a> paradigm of Western philosophy we learn about in textbooks. Some of his works include <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144915.Tragic_Sense_of_Life" class="textlink" target="_blank">The Tragic Sense of Life</a></i> (1912), a collection of essays exploring the interplay between skepticism and faith, and <i><a href="http://armandfbaker.com/translations/unamuno/san_manuel_bueno_martir.pdf" class="textlink" target="_blank">San Manuel Bueno, Martir</a></i> (1930), a novella about a priest who must tackle internal dilemmas about his service.

    	Discovering philosophy as a discipline was one of my most mind-boggling experiences. Philosophers, it seemed, were asking and attempting to answer the most fundamental and nagging questions: do we have free will? does God exist? what exists? how do we know things? what is the nature of consciousness? Moreover, philosophy seemed to pervade every field of study: mathemathics, physics, art, astronomy, etc. Whatever questions were the hardest, most abstract, and most unanswerable in field X were just considered a topic of study in "philosophy of X".
    	<br><br>
    	While the idea of philosophy being "the field of unanswerable questions" renders philosophy one of the most vibrant, wide-reaching, and thought-provoking disciplines, it also renders academic philosophy a risky vocational pursuit. These days, there are no "professional philosophers" besides philosophy professors.
    	<br><br>
    	That's <i>kind of</i> why I halted my undergrad philosophy studies. 
    	Regardless, philosophy is still one of my highest and most enjoyable endeavors. Whether in the form of truth-seeking, asking hard questions, using formal philosophical tools, or tackling classic philosophy problems, philosophy is a large part of my daily life and is the bedrock upon which my worldview lies. Today, I highly enjoy reading and writing about philosophy of science (how do we grow scientific knowledge? what justifies induction?), philosophy of mind (what is it like to be something? are the mind and body separate?), logic (are our mathematical systems complete? are they decideable?), and moral philosophy (what is justice? what should we do?)&mdash;much of which is relevant to both my personal growth and my studies in math and computer science. I co-founded a <a class="textlink" href="https://pocab.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">philosophy of computation group</a> at Berkeley, now led by <a class="textlink" a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jjbaek/" target="_blank">Jerome Baek</a>, where students and professors can freely discuss topics in the intersection of philosophy and computer science.
    	<br><br>
    	Philosophy is not just academic philosophy, and I think an understanding of it can deeply enrich anyone's life.
