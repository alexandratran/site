    	Some people say that <a class="textlink" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer" target="_blank">politics is the mind-killer</a>, and I certainly agree. However, I can't avoid the fact that I've been deeply involved in political groups in the past several years and that wherever I end up, I'm somehow always distinguished by my contrarian political views.
    	<br><br>
    	These days I don't go out of my way to partake in politically-charged activities, or make politically-charged statements&mdash;but politics is still the thread that runs through much of what I do.
    	<br><br>
    	My political philosophy boils down to the axiom that coercion is bad&mdash;coercion in the form of war, torture, regulation, criminalization, violence, taxation, trade barriers, etc. Yes&mdash;these all indeed tend to involve non-reactive coercion, i.e. violation of peaceful individuals' autonomy, and this autonomy is something that I believe, when maximized, yields a prosperous, coordinated, and flourishing society. Yes&mdash;I am a libertarian, and one commited enough to logical deduction that I'll identify as a categorical anarcho-capitalist. Yes&mdash;I believe that my political stance has come from my best attempt at un-biased reasoning and observation, even though I still have massive gaps of knowledge. If I am wrong, I (think I) would be happy to adjust my stance.
    	<br><br>
    	One of my earliest exposures to libertarian political philosophy was in early high school, when I watched Michael Sandel's Harvard philosophy course on <a class="textlink" href="http://justiceharvard.org/" target="_blank">Justice</a> and read the eponymous book. He brings to life the classic "trolley problem" and its variants, and juxtaposes libertarianism and utilitarianism (which today, I don't think are all that separable, although at the time, my distaste of ends-justify-the-means utilitarianism drew me to libertarianism).
    	<br><br>
    	I'm a little too young to have been picked up by the Ron Paul movement during the '08 and '12 elections, but I do admire his legacy now. Tom Woods, historian and close colleague of Ron Paul runs <a class="textlink" href="https://tomwoods.com/" target="_blank">two</a> <a class="textlink" href="https://contrakrugman.com/" target="_blank">podcasts</a> that I've been listening to for years, and frankly, I'm constantly surprised by Woods's intellectual rigor.
    	<br><br>
    	I'm ashamed to have not yet gotten around to thoroughly studying many of the libertarian greats, like Rothbard, Milton Friedman, Sowell, Hayek, and Smith. However, I'm familiar with their work, and regardless, I reject the idea of there existing a literary canon one <i>must</i> consume to reap certain truths.
    	<br><br>
    	There are many modern libertarian thinkers I enjoy: see <a class="textlink" href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~huemer/" target="_blank">Michael Huemer</a>, who has a unique gift for persuading skeptics of anarchism. His written work has been incredibly influential, especially <i>The Problem of Political Authority</i>; I could not recommend him more. See <a class="textlink" href="http://sites.sandiego.edu/mzwolinski/" target="_blank">Matt Zwolinski</a>, who has amazing articulacy. He leads the Bleeding Heart Libertarians community, and has excellent material debunking traditional assumptions about exploitation and ethical consumerism (note: the study of popular counter-rational narratives, like the protest and regulation against exploitation, is at the top of my interests list). See <a class="textlink" href="http://bcaplan.com/" target="_blank">Bryan Caplan</a>, who writes and speaks on not only politics, but also education, economics, child-rearing, and human rationality. See <a class="textlink" href="http://daviddfriedman.com/" target="_blank">David Friedman</a>. See <a class="textlink" href="http://www.jeffreytucker.me/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Tucker</a>.
