    	Some people say that <a class="textlink" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer" target="_blank">politics is the mind-killer</a>, and I agree. However, I can't avoid the fact that I've been deeply involved in political groups in the past several years and people often distinguish me by my contrarian political views.
    	<br><br>
    	These days I don't go out of my way to partake in politically-charged activities, or make politically-charged statements&mdash;but politics is still the thread that runs through much of what I do.
    	<br><br>
    	My political philosophy reduces down to the axiom that coercion is bad&mdash;coercion in the form of war, torture, regulation, criminalization, taxation, trade barriers, etc. Yes, these all indeed tend to involve unprovoked coercion, i.e. restriction or infringement of the autonomy of peaceful actors. Coercion is bad because this autonomy, this self-determination of citizens, strongly correlates with the prosperity, harmony, and durability of a society, and thus should be limited only with great caution. Yes, I am a libertarian, and one commited enough to logical deduction that I'll identify as a categorical anarchist. Even though I have massive gaps of knowledge, my political stance has come from my best attempt at un-biased reasoning and observation. If I am wrong, I (think I) would be happy to adjust my stance.
    	<br><br>
    	One of my earliest exposures to libertarian political philosophy was in early high school, when I watched Michael Sandel's Harvard philosophy course on <a class="textlink" href="http://justiceharvard.org/" target="_blank">Justice</a> and read the eponymous book. He brings to life the classic "trolley problem" and its variants, and juxtaposes libertarianism and utilitarianism (which today, I don't think are all that separable, although at the time, my distaste of ends-justify-the-means utilitarianism drew me to libertarianism).
    	<br><br>
    	I'm a little too young to have been picked up by the Ron Paul movement during the '08 and '12 elections, but <a href="images/ronpaul.jpg" class="textlink" target="_blank">I do admire his legacy now</a>. Tom Woods, historian and close colleague of Ron Paul runs <a class="textlink" href="https://tomwoods.com/" target="_blank">two</a> <a class="textlink" href="https://contrakrugman.com/" target="_blank">podcasts</a> that I've been listening to for years, and frankly, I'm constantly surprised by Woods's intellectual rigor.
    	<br><br>
    	I'm no expert on the historical libertarian heavyweights, like Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, Nozick, Milton Friedman, Sowell, and their forefathers, Smith, Burke, Locke, etc. However, I'm familiar with much of their work (especially Hayek <a class="textlink" href="https://fee.org/articles/individualism-true-and-false/" target="_blank">on individualism</a>), and regardless, I reject the idea of there existing a literary canon one <i>must</i> consume to reap certain truths.
    	<br><br>
    	There are many modern libertarian thinkers I enjoy: see <a class="textlink" href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~huemer/" target="_blank">Michael Huemer</a>, who has a unique gift for persuading skeptics of anarchism. His written work has been incredibly influential, especially <i>The Problem of Political Authority</i>; I could not recommend him more. See <a class="textlink" href="http://sites.sandiego.edu/mzwolinski/" target="_blank">Matt Zwolinski</a>, who has amazing articulacy. He leads the Bleeding Heart Libertarians community, and has excellent material debunking traditional assumptions about exploitation and ethical consumerism (note: the study of unanimously popular counter-rational narratives, like the protest and regulation against exploitation, is at the top of my interests list). See <a class="textlink" href="http://bcaplan.com/" target="_blank">Bryan Caplan</a>, who writes and speaks on not only politics, but also education, economics, child-rearing, and human rationality. See <a class="textlink" href="http://daviddfriedman.com/" target="_blank">David Friedman</a>. See <a class="textlink" href="http://www.jeffreytucker.me/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Tucker</a>.
